# Navigating the Maze: Evaluating Exploration Strategies in a Maze Environment
A project in reinforcement learning where we'll create a dynamic maze with agents trying to explore it

## Objective:

To implement and assess various exploration strategies in Reinforcement Learning within a maze-like grid world. The project aims to understand how different exploration methods influence the agent's ability to navigate and solve a maze.

## Background:

In a maze, the agent must find a path from a starting point to a goal, dealing with dead ends and complex pathways. This scenario effectively illustrates the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma in RL, making it a fitting choice for your project.

## Methodology:

Environment Setup: Create a simple maze environment. This can be a static maze with a fixed layout or a dynamic one where the maze structure changes every episode.
Implement Exploration Strategies:
Epsilon-Greedy Strategy.
Boltzmann Exploration (Softmax).
UCB (Upper Confidence Bound).
Integrate with an RL Algorithm: Use a basic RL algorithm like Q-Learning or SARSA for the agent to learn how to navigate the maze.
Experimentation and Analysis:
Evaluate each strategy's performance in terms of time/steps taken to solve the maze, success rate, and learning stability.
Analyze how each strategy copes with dead ends and route changes (in case of a dynamic maze).
Reporting: Document the design, implementation, experiments, and findings. Discuss the challenges faced by the agent in the maze environment and how different exploration strategies mitigate these challenges.
Expected Outcomes:

Insights into the effectiveness of exploration strategies in a more complex environment than a standard grid world.
Comparative analysis of how well each strategy helps the agent to learn in a maze environment.
Understanding of the challenges in applying RL to spatial navigation problems.
Alignment with Curriculum:

This project is in line with the principles and theories taught in your RL course. It leverages key concepts like exploration strategies, Q-Learning, and SARSA, which are fundamental to understanding RL dynamics in complex environments.



## Choosing Backend endpoint:
Both Flask and FastAPI are modern web frameworks for building APIs in Python, but they cater to slightly different needs and preferences. Here's a breakdown of their pros and cons:

### Flask
#### Pros:

Simplicity: Flask is known for being simple and easy to get started with. Its minimalistic and unopinionated approach makes it a go-to choice for small to medium projects.
Flexibility: Because it imposes little boilerplate, Flask allows for more control over the components you include in your application.
Extensive Ecosystem: Flask has a mature ecosystem with a wide range of extensions for adding functionality such as ORM, form validation, and more.
Widely Used: It has been around for a longer time, which means there's a large community, plenty of resources, and good support.
#### Cons:

Performance: Flask uses a synchronous model, which can be less efficient under load compared to asynchronous frameworks, especially for I/O bound operations.
More Boilerplate for APIs: You may end up writing more code for tasks like request validation, serialization, and documentation because these aren't included out of the box.
### FastAPI
#### Pros:

Performance: FastAPI is built on Starlette and Pydantic, which means it's asynchronous and generally faster than Flask, especially for I/O bound tasks.
Automatic API Documentation: FastAPI automatically generates documentation (with Swagger/UI and ReDoc) for your API, which can be a huge timesaver.
Data Validation and Serialization: Pydantic integration provides powerful data validation and serialization out of the box.
Modern Python Features: FastAPI encourages the use of modern Python features like type hints, which improves code quality and editor support.
Built for APIs: It's designed to create APIs quickly and efficiently, with a lot of features such as dependency injection, WebSocket support, and background tasks built-in.
#### Cons:

Relative Newcomer: FastAPI is newer, so while it's growing rapidly, the community is smaller, and there may be fewer resources and extensions compared to Flask.
Asynchronous Learning Curve: If you're not familiar with async programming in Python, there can be a learning curve to using FastAPI effectively.
API-Centric: FastAPI is designed primarily for APIs, so if you're looking for a general-purpose web framework, it may not be as suitable as Flask.
In summary, Flask is a mature and straightforward option for those who want simplicity and flexibility, especially for smaller projects or when you need a general-purpose web framework. FastAPI, on the other hand, is a high-performance, modern framework that's ideal for building APIs, especially when speed and automatic API documentation are priorities. The choice between the two often comes down to the specific needs of the project and the familiarity of the development team with asynchronous programming.
