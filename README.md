# Navigating the Maze: Evaluating Exploration Strategies in a Maze Environment
A project in reinforcement learning where we'll create a dynamic maze with agents trying to explore it

## Objective:

To implement and assess various exploration strategies in Reinforcement Learning within a maze-like grid world. The project aims to understand how different exploration methods influence the agent's ability to navigate and solve a maze.

## Background:

In a maze, the agent must find a path from a starting point to a goal, dealing with dead ends and complex pathways. This scenario effectively illustrates the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma in RL, making it a fitting choice for your project.

## Methodology:

Environment Setup: Create a simple maze environment. This can be a static maze with a fixed layout or a dynamic one where the maze structure changes every episode.
Implement Exploration Strategies:
Epsilon-Greedy Strategy.
Boltzmann Exploration (Softmax).
UCB (Upper Confidence Bound).
Integrate with an RL Algorithm: Use a basic RL algorithm like Q-Learning or SARSA for the agent to learn how to navigate the maze.
Experimentation and Analysis:
Evaluate each strategy's performance in terms of time/steps taken to solve the maze, success rate, and learning stability.
Analyze how each strategy copes with dead ends and route changes (in case of a dynamic maze).
Reporting: Document the design, implementation, experiments, and findings. Discuss the challenges faced by the agent in the maze environment and how different exploration strategies mitigate these challenges.
Expected Outcomes:

Insights into the effectiveness of exploration strategies in a more complex environment than a standard grid world.
Comparative analysis of how well each strategy helps the agent to learn in a maze environment.
Understanding of the challenges in applying RL to spatial navigation problems.
Alignment with Curriculum:

This project is in line with the principles and theories taught in your RL course. It leverages key concepts like exploration strategies, Q-Learning, and SARSA, which are fundamental to understanding RL dynamics in complex environments.
